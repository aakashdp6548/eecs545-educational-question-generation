billions of stars of all sizes , black holes , active galactic nuclei , astroids , planets and more . during violent disturbances , such as a large star exploding into a supernova , billions of particles are emitted into space . although they are called rays , cosmic rays consist of these high energy particles rather than the photons that make up light rays . while the light from an explosion travels in a straight line at its famous constant speed , the particles are trapped in extraordinary loops by magnetic shockwaves generated by the explosion . crossing back and forth through these magnetic field lines accelerates them to almost the speed of light before they escape . there are lots of cosmic rays in space , and some of these particles have traveled for billions of years before reaching earth . when they enter our atmosphere , they collide with the molecules there , generating secondary cosmic rays , lighter particles with less energy than the original .	what are the differences between the propagation of light and particles in space ?	what are the differences between the propagation of light and particles in space ?

cobalt sponge absorbs lots and lots of gas for perhaps hydrogenation . many years ago , in the 1970s , when there was a civil war in africa in the region katanga where cobalt is mined , there was a shortage of cobalt and the production of colour televisions stopped for some considerable time until the production restarted . so you can see it flows in the bottle .	why did a civil war in the area of katanga ( africa ) affect the world production of televisions in the 1970s ?	why did a civil war in the area of katanga ( africa ) affect the world production of televisions in the 1970s ?

these bubbles get trapped by gluten and create a sponge-like structure that gives the bread its soft texture . wine also relies on yeast . but a wine-making set-up keeps the oxygen levels low so that yeast consume sugar using fermentation , the anaerobic pathway .	which of these foods can also be added to the video ?	which of these foods can also be added to the video ?
in the 1920s , kurt gödel showed that you can never prove that the continuum hypothesis is false . then , in the 1960s , paul j. cohen showed that you can never prove that the continuum hypothesis is true . taken together , these results mean that there are unanswerable questions in mathematics .	the work of which two mathematicians showed that the question of whether or not the continuum hypothesis is true is an unanswerable question ?	the work of which two mathematicians showed that the question of whether or not the continuum hypothesis is true is an unanswerable question ?
under the terms of the articles , all 13 states had to agree to any changes . since the purpose of the convention is just to make recommendations , not everyone is excited about attending , and frankly , some think it 's a waste of time . as men from different parts of the country began to travel down dusty , rugged roads on the way to philadelphia , not all states send delegates .	the stated purpose of the grand convention was to	the stated purpose of the grand convention was to

because it 's also useful in studying curves , pi helps us understand periodic or oscillating systems like clocks , electromagnetic waves , and even music . in statistics , pi is used in the equation to calculate the area under a normal distribution curve , which comes in handy for figuring out distributions of standardized test scores , financial models , or margins of error in scientific results . as if that were n't enough , pi is used in particle physics experiments , such as those using the large hadron collider , not only due to its round shape , but more subtly , because of the orbits in which tiny particles move .	in ________ , pi is used to calculate the area under a ________ .	in ________ , pi is used to calculate the area under a ________ .
for example , our moon has no atmosphere , and so if you spill some water on the moon , it will either boil away as vapor , or freeze solid to make ice . without the pressure of an atmosphere , liquid water ca n't survive . third , the planet needs to be at the right distance from its star .	why do planets need to have an atmosphere in order for liquid water to exist ?	why do planets need to have an atmosphere in order for liquid water to exist ?

but banting chose to share his portion with charles best , for his help in the initial studies involving dogs . but while medical experimentation on animals remains controversial , in this case at least , it was not just a matter of exploiting dogs for human needs . dogs develop diabetes at the rate of two cases per 1,000 dogs , almost the same as that of humans under 20 . most canine cases are of type 1 diabetes , similar to the type that young children develop following immune system destruction of the pancreas , and genetic studies have shown that the dog disease has many similar hallmarks of the human disease .	consider that humans and dogs can now be treated with recombinant expressed ( manufactured in a test tube ) insulin following molecular genetic sequencing . in light of this , have the need and the manner of animal experimentation become more refined over time ?	consider that humans and dogs can now be treated with recombinant expressed ( manufactured in a test tube ) insulin following molecular genetic sequencing . in light of this , have the need and the manner of animal experimentation become more refined over time ?
in some ways , this is the opposite of seeing floaters . here , you are not seeing shadows but little moving windows letting light through to your retina . the windows are actually caused by white blood cells moving through the capillaries along your retina 's surface . these leukocytes can be so large that they nearly fill a capillary causing a plasma space to open up in front of them .	the astronomer johannes kepler was the first scientist to explain that the eye works by focusing an image of the outside world onto the retina . however , we can see floaters just in front of the retina and white blood cells moving in the capillaries on the retina because of the shadows they cast and the light they let through . no focusing of an image is involved . can you think of any other things and ways we might see that also do not rely on the focusing of an image on the retina ?	the astronomer johannes kepler was the first scientist to explain that the eye works by focusing an image of the outside world onto the retina . however , we can see floaters just in front of the retina and white blood cells moving in the capillaries on the retina because of the shadows they cast and the light they let through . no focusing of an image is involved . can you think of any other things and ways we might see that also do not rely on the focusing of an image on the retina ?
