most of our cells need oxygen because it 's one of the key ingredients of aerobic respiration . that 's the process that produces a molecule called atp , which our cells use to power their many incredible functions . but getting oxygen throughout our bodies is a surprisingly difficult task .
it has contributed to the world concepts such as yoga , ayurveda , spicy chicken tikka , and vedic math . vedic math is one of the world 's easiest and simplest way to do math . we are going to combine together and do some number crunching today .
these early artists mixed minerals , clay , charcoal , and ochre with spit or animal fat to create paint . they drew with their hands and tools , like pads of moss , twigs , bones , and hair . in many instances , their images follow the contours of the cave to create depth and shade .

standard candles are objects whose intrinsic brightness , or luminosity , we know really well . for example , if you know how bright your light bulb is , and you ask your friend to hold the light bulb and walk away from you , you know that the amount of light you receive from your friend will decrease by the distance squared . so by comparing the amount of light you receive to the intrinsic brightness of the light bulb , you can then tell how far away your friend is . in astronomy , our light bulb turns out to be a special type of star called a cepheid variable . these stars are internally unstable , like a constantly inflating and deflating balloon .

the ability to use the power of 10 as an estimation tool can come in handy every now and again , like when you 're trying to guess the number of m & amp ; amp ; m 's in a jar , but is also an essential skill in math and science , especially when dealing with what are known as fermi problems . fermi problems are named after the physicist enrico fermi , who 's famous for making rapid order-of-magnitude estimations , or rapid estimations , with seemingly little available data . fermi worked on the manhattan project in developing the atomic bomb , and when it was tested at the trinity site in 1945 , fermi dropped a few pieces of paper during the blast and used the distance they traveled backwards as they fell to estimate the strength of the explosion as 10 kilotons of tnt , which is on the same order of magnitude as the actual value of 20 kilotons . one example of the classic fermi estimation problems is to determine how many piano tuners there are in the city of chicago , illinois .

newton experimented extensively with optics , and came to understand light as something of substance , and colors as components of light at different frequencies . before newton , people widely believed that the color was due to different amounts of light , with red being lots of light , and blue being mostly dark . newton 's prism experiments showed that white light could not only be broken into its component colors with one prism , but that a second lens could recompose those colors back into white light again , thus showing that color was a matter of light 's refraction rather than how light or dark it was .

air over the top goes significantly faster , reaching the trailing edge first . so how does a wing actually generate lift ? well the key is the wing must deflect air downwards this can be achieved using asymmetric or cambered air foils or by increasing the angle of attack air under the wing is deflected down and by the coanda effect air above the wing is guided along its surface and down as well since the air is slowed and deflected down by the wing , it pushes the wing up and back .

if you spent any time on earth you might have noticed that humans are not the most rational creatures we make decisions based mostly on emotions instead of facts and a lot of times we 're guided by tribal instinct part of the problem is that the human brain evolved to help us survive and not necessarily to help us be factually accurate so we often respond better to social and tribal dynamics than to intellectual analysis for example if someone 's tribe believes that obama is a secret muslim born in kenya that person probably thinks the hard proof of his us birth certificate is fake that conclusion is neither rational nor accurate but from a tribal perspective it makes sense it 's safer to agree with your tribe and stay united ideologically even if you 're wrong about the facts than to disagree and isolate yourself another part of the problem is that our brain is constantly protecting our worldview and sense of identity so when our worldview is challenged that same part of the brain that processes physical danger gets activated this is why people sometimes react so aggressively to information that proves them wrong and this is why it 's often so hard to have an intelligent political debate several studies have also shown that there is a backfire effect that happens when people encounter facts that contradict their current beliefs they actually become more convinced of their original ideas so fighting ignorant with facts is like fighting a grease fire with water it seems like it should work but it actually just makes the whole thing work lastly there 's the problem of lack of empathy several studies have found that when humans are divided into groups of any kind we instinctively become less and pathetic to members of other groups that means that for survivals sake we men instinctively empathize less with other races other nationalities and even though their sports teams this instinctive the humanization of other groups is what makes things like slavery and genocide possible in our society so what can you do if you want someone to consider factual information that clashes with their beliefs first you have to prevent their brain from seeing you as a personal threat so look for ways to identify the person as part of your tribe and you as part of theirs hey we 're part of the same family hey we 're both parents hey we both still play pokemon go whatever anything that communicates that you 're part of the same that 's the first step second consider the possibility that you may be wrong maybe the facts are not on your side in which case admitting it will help you model to the other person that it 's okay to be wrong i understand that none of this is easy or smooth but if we want to continue to function as a stable society we have to learn to get past our own natural biases only when that happens we will be able to move forward towards a better future

in the mid-fifteenth century , fist developed into the verb fisten , to break wind , which eventually lead to the modern word feisty , but that 's another story . in its earliest form , as a variant of fisten , fizzle had a very specific meaning : to break wind without noise . surprisingly , considering this initial definition , by the 1800s , the word fizzle referred instead to a specific sound , rather graphically , to the sputtering or hissing of a gas or liquid being forced out of a narrow opening . the figurative sense of the word , a weak ending , is thus understandable within the context of a flame consuming the last drops of oil in a lantern or a valve drawing out the contents of the bottom of a cask .

the ability to use the power of 10 as an estimation tool can come in handy every now and again , like when you 're trying to guess the number of m & amp ; amp ; m 's in a jar , but is also an essential skill in math and science , especially when dealing with what are known as fermi problems . fermi problems are named after the physicist enrico fermi , who 's famous for making rapid order-of-magnitude estimations , or rapid estimations , with seemingly little available data . fermi worked on the manhattan project in developing the atomic bomb , and when it was tested at the trinity site in 1945 , fermi dropped a few pieces of paper during the blast and used the distance they traveled backwards as they fell to estimate the strength of the explosion as 10 kilotons of tnt , which is on the same order of magnitude as the actual value of 20 kilotons .

wernicke 's connectionist model helped explain disorders that did n't result from the dysfunction of just one area . modern neuroscience tools reveal a brain more complex than gratiolet , aubertin , or even wernicke imagined . today , the hippocampus is associated with two distinct brain functions : creating memories and processing location in space . we also now measure two kinds of connectivity : anatomical connectivity between two adjoining regions of cortex working together , and functional connectivity between separated regions working together to accomplish one process . a seemingly basic function like vision is actually composed of many smaller functions , with different parts of the cortex representing shape , color and location in space .

this is a map of yellowstone national park for the most part the park is in wyoming but it extends a bit into montana and idaho this little 50 square miles section in idaho is what concerns us it 's called the zone of death because of a loophole that exists in the constitution of the united states if someone were to exploit that loophole they might be able to get away with murder yellowstone was established in 1872 before wyoming idaho and montana join the union it 's federal land and always has been but federal land across the u.s. is split up and divided into its corresponding state district courts except for yellowstone and this is where the loophole begins law professor brian c. kalt points out in his 2005 paper the perfect crime that yellowstone national park was assigned fully to wyoming 's district court even though small portions fall into montana and idaho unlike every other district the district of wyoming includes land in other state so kalt asks the question what happens if you 're caught for a crime you committed in that 50 square mile idea who region of the park the first thing law enforcement would do is bring you to cheyenne the hub of the district court of wyoming because the crime technically happened within wyoming 's jurisdiction but article 3 section 2 of the united states constitution says that the trial should happen in the state where you committed the crime if you 're a savvy murderer you invoke your right to a trial in idaho so they bring you back to idaho no big deal in the sixth amendment they said that they would require local juries and the language they use is that the jury has to be from the state and district where the crime was committed this is called the vicinage clause that leaves you with a sort of venn diagram you have the right to demand jury from that middle area where the state in which you committed the crime that 's idaho overlaps with the judicial jurisdiction where you committed the crime the wyoming district that has jurisdiction over yellowstone national park and here 's the problem nobody lives there there 's there 's no way for them to give you a trial and so i argue they should have to let you go this could also happen in the montana portion of the park except a few dozen people do live there so a jury could theoretically be called kalt has proposed numerous solutions to congress to fix the loophole but they have yet to act all they have to do is redraw the district line so that the district of wyoming is wyoming the district of idaho is in idaho and the district of montana in montana and if they do that it all goes away so if you 're planning a gathering of your adversaries exes and debtors maybe try yosemite

so in the equation representing their relationship , stiffness and natural frequency are proportional to one another , while mass and natural frequency are inversely proportional . what happened in mexico city was an effect called resonance , where the frequency of the earthquake 's seismic waves happen to match the natural frequency of the midsized buildings . like a well-timed push on a swingset , each additional seismic wave amplified the building 's vibration in its current direction , causing it to swing even further back , and so on , eventually reaching a far greater extent than the initial displacement . today , engineers work with geologists and seismologists to predict the frequency of earthquake motions at building sites in order to prevent resonance-induced collapses , taking into account factors such as soil type and fault type , as well as data from previous quakes . low frequencies of motion will cause more damage to taller and more flexible buildings , while high frequencies of motion pose more threat to structures that are shorter and stiffer .

for instance , even a few cumulus clouds in front of the sun can reduce the electricity production in solar towers to almost zero because of this dependence on direct rays . in solar panels , those clouds would decrease energy output as well , though not as much because solar panels can use all types of irradiance . however , all this depends on the clouds exact positioning . due to reflection , or a particular phenomeon called mie scattering , the sun 's rays can actually be focused forward by clouds to create a more than 50 % increase in the solar irradiance reaching a solar panel . if this potential increase is n't accounted for , it could damage the solar panel .

these sequential compressions create sound waves , and the ones inside the guitar mostly escape through the hole . they eventually propagate to your ear , which translates them into electrical impulses that your brain interprets as sound . the pitch of that sound depends on the frequency of the compressions . a quickly vibrating string will cause a lot of compressions close together , making a high-pitched sound , and a slow vibration produces a low-pitched sound . four things affect the frequency of a vibrating string : the length , the tension , the density and the thickness .
