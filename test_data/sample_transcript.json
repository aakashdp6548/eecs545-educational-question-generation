Voiceover:Gavin has these horses.
0:02
Is the number of horses in each picture below
0:06
more than, less than, or same as
0:11
the number of horses Gavin has?
0:14
Let's first look at how many horses Gavin has.
0:19
He has one, two, three, four, five, six horses.
0:25
Let's remember that
0:27
and let's compare each of these amounts of horses
0:30
to the six horses that Gavin has.
0:33
Let's look over here,
0:35
over here we have one, two, three,
0:39
four, five, six horses.
0:41
This is the same number that Gavin has,
0:44
they're just arranged differently.
0:46
This is the same,
0:49
we'll put in the Same as bucket.
0:52
Now, here we have one, two, three, four five horses.
0:57
This is less than the six horses that Gavin has,
1:02
five is less than six.
1:04
Here and I can just look at this
1:06
and see that there's more than six
1:08
but we can count them.
1:09
We have one, two, three, four, five,
1:11
and then another five that's going to be 10.
1:13
Or we can say one, two, three, four, five,
1:16
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
1:18
Well 10 is more than six,
1:20
10 is more than six,
1:23
so we'll put it in the More than bucket.
1:25
Now here we have four and four
1:29
well that's going to be eight.
1:30
One, two, three, four,
1:32
five, six, seven, eight.
1:33
It's again, that is more than the six up here.
1:39
That's more than six
1:40
and then here we have one, two,
1:42
three, four horses.
1:43
Well four is less than six,
1:46
so I will put that,
1:48
I will put that in the less than,
1:52
in the Less than bucket just like that.
1:55
Let's check our answer to see how we did.
2:00
We got it right.
